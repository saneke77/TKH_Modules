			<p> My name is Stacy Ikechukwu Jr. Aneke. I am a 22 year-old 1st-generation Nigerian American who just recently graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles with a B.A. in Linguistics & Psychology. I am an Igbo boy who loves my culture and who is currently trying to make the big transition into adulthood with my pursuit of a post-graduate degree in Clinical and Mental Health Counseling at Regent University. My relationship with God is very important to me and I love any conversations about any faith-based topics, but specifically Christianity because they allow me to feel a sense of spiritual connection and growth I don't get in many other places.In my free time I love to watch anime and Youtube videos. I love meeting up with friends and Freestyling to whatever beats we can find (this was especially the case before Covid). I love to try new activities especially in regards to eating or traveling, and I enjoy getting lost in the moments that I spend with the people I care about. </p>
